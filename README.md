# Electric Field Visualizer
---

In my first year of physics one of the most difficult concepts for me was the electrical and magnetic fields of charged particles. I built this visualizer to help me 
build a conceptual understanding of how fields are affected by the arrangements and magnitudes of charged particles, as well as to build up my skills using the python
"scientific stack". This is an on going project and will continue to improve as my skills with the libraries improve. This initial version is a simple demo and to get me comfortable with the libraries.

![v1_test1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb27cb8-da65-4af1-ae0c-94fa063cb24e)
Current Features: 
- Basic Computation of vector field using numpy functions
- Simple matplotlib plots

Next Steps:
- Add functionality to read from extra source such as csv using pandas
- Optimize calculate functions
- Make the visual prettier and try to fix cutting/off center vectors
